# Introduction to L-Systems

A [Lindenmayer system](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/L-system) is "a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar". Theorized by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968, they are a way of modeling the growth of an **organism** or generating **fractals**.

## Definition of an L-System

An L-System is composed of an alphabet, some constants, an axiom describing the initial state and evolution rules for each variable.

For instance, here is Lindenmayer's original L-System modeling the growth of an algae:

<LSystemDescriptorWidget descriptor={lsystemAlgaeDescriptor} />

The evolution rules then allow us to iterate this L-System as such:

{/* <ol class="flex flex-col">
{#each lsystemAlgaeStates as algaeState, generationIndex}
  <li>Generation #{generationIndex} state: {algaeState}</li>
{/each}
</ol> */}

...and so on.

## Rendering

Now that we have a "growing" iterative L-System, we need to somehow render it to the screen. How do we do that?

### Turtles all the way down

Inspired by the [Logo programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>)'s Turtle graphics module, we need to use a visual "cursor" which has a position (`X` and `Y`) and an angle.

We move the turtle forward when encountering a _variable_, and perform operations for _constants_: rotation and saving/restoring the turtle's state to/from a stack.

From any given state and its associated set of rules, we can now compute a set of coordinates to be drawn sequentially as line segments.

This is done internally by the `traceLSystem` function, which outputs coordinates then rendered with **d3.js** in a purpose-made Svelte component.

### Sierpinski's Triangle

Let's apply this "tracing then rendering" logic to a new L-System.

This one is a slightly more evolved L-System than our algae. We now have constants, `+` and `-`, to angle the trajectory of our turtle:

<LSystemDescriptorWidget descriptor={lsystemSierpinski.descriptor} />

Let's see what this gives us after several iterations (you can control the current generation with the slider):

<LSystemControllableTracingRenderer
  lsystem={lsystemSierpinski}
  minGeneration={0}
  maxGeneration={8}
  strokeWidthScale={g => (g + 1) / 50}
/>

It appears that this L-System describes, in fact, a fractal.

## Applications

Of course, L-Systems have real-word applications beyond just making pretty fractals.

By introducing 3D logic to our turtle system, randomization parameters and improving the renderer (dynamic colors and stroke widths, textures, _etc._) you can get pretty realistic procedural content generation of many real-life things.

Here are a few examples.

## Fractals

You thought we were done?

Fractal-like forms are often easy to describe as L-Systems due to their mathematical properties.

We saw Sierpinski's Triangle just above, here is another famous example:

<LSystemDescriptorWidget descriptor={lsystemKochSnowflake.descriptor} />

<LSystemControllableTracingRenderer
  lsystem={lsystemKochSnowflake}
  minGeneration={0}
  maxGeneration={6}
  initialGeneration={4}
  strokeWidthScale={g => (g + 1) / 5}
/>

## Plants

<LSystemDescriptorWidget descriptor={lsystemTree.descriptor} />

<LSystemControllableTracingRenderer
  lsystem={lsystemTree}
  minGeneration={2}
  maxGeneration={8}
  initialGeneration={4}
  strokeWidthScale={() => 1.0}
  strokeColor="#689311"
  initialAngle={90}
/>

## Cities

L-Systems can be applied to city generation by producing roads and even buildings.

For instance, Parish and MÃ¼ller's [Procedural Modeling of Cities paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220720591_Procedural_Modeling_of_Cities) extends L-Systems to allow for realistic generation of roads and buildings.
