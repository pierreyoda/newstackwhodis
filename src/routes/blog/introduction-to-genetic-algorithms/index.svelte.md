# Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

## The What

Genetic Algorithms are a class of heuristic algorithms mimicking the natural mechanism of evolution.

## The Why

NP-hard problems
traveling salesman

## The How

## In-Browser Application

### Implementation

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will use a tiny, purpose-made Genetic Algorithms library in Typescript.

The visualization itself is done in Svelte.

### Demonstration

## Real-World Applications

markets modeling
vehicule routing
Bio-informatics
