# Code 201 From programmer to engineer

## Problem solving

Engineering is problem solving.

## Software Architecture

Software architecture is the modelisation of code.

### Modelisation

Software modelisation is the modelisation of data.

Data-Driven Development is a very important idea to apply wherever possible.

### Refactoring

The rule of thumb of refactoring is to wait for three similar cases.

Don't repeat yourself, but avoid early over-engineering.

## Moderation

We all have our opinion on various technologies or practices. A sign of maturity in this job is to set these aside for a minute and think about the best tool for the task at hand.

A technology is a tool. Like every tool, it has its shortcomings and its advantages. You don't use a screwdriver for nailing a hammer.

Let's take lambda functions for instance. It can be really useful and cheaper than a more classical server architecture, but also has great limitations, like pricing.

Everything has a cost, especially in technology. It is up to the stakeholders to weight these costs against the potential benefits.

## Knowing the unknown

In technology, there are four categories of issues, from easiest to hardest to handle:

- Known knowns
- Unknown knowns
- Known unknowns
- Unknown unknowns

We know what we know, and we sometimes can know what we don't know.

## Bugs

When it rains it pours.

The worst bugs happen due to the swiss cheese model: when several failures trigger at more or less the same time.

### Organization

Code follows the structure of an organization. The reverse is also a bit true.
