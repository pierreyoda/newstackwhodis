# About Me

Hi! :wave:

My name is Pierre-Yves.

I'm a French Software Engineer in his mid-twenties.

My main professional specialty is Typescript, both on the front-end (React, Angular, Vue.js) and on the back-end (Node.js, mainly NestJS as a framework).

I also do **a lot** of Rust for my [personal projects](https://github.com/pierreyoda)!

You can check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierre-yves-diallo-567028113/) for more information about my career.
