# Code 101 - Programing essentials

## Why learn how to program?

Programming is a profession of the future. It is cross-disciplinary and present in all sectors, and also accessible to everyone - as long as you have an internet connection and a computer or even a smartphone nowadays. The public library is also a possibility.

The advantage of this area is the low number of barriers to entry: one can disregard diplomas and other expensive training courses as long as one has the motivation and ability to learn.

These capacities are, broadly speaking:
- Perseverance
- Rigor
- Adaptation
- Curiosity
- Fluency in English (hard to escape!)

These conditions being met, one can train on the fly on all the technologies necessary to find a job relatively easily compared to other sectors.

Web development is probably the most accessible path in the sector. Indeed, the result is immediate to the naked eye on the "front-end" (visible part of a website or application). The "back-end" part is the hidden side of the iceberg but corresponds in fact to the servers and databases part. A "full-stack" developer or engineer reconciles at least the two, plus possibly other areas that we will talk about later.

There are several axes to be mastered, apparently distinct but which finally come together. We will talk about them in the following chapters.

Technology watch is the action of keeping up to date with industry trends, both old and new. As in medicine or law, the computer engineer must be up to date.

An engineer is a person capable of conducting work in the broadest sense.
