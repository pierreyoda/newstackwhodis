# Why I Chose tailwindcss

[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that has seen major popularity gains lately.

It uses a manifest file to generate all its utility classes.

For almost four years now, I've been using it exclusively wherever I could, be it in professional or personal projects.
